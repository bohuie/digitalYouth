<b>Introduction</b><br />

You are invited to participate in a research project that concerns the problem of how to help
 youths in rural communities stay local and how to increase local job opportunities that require
 new digital skills, such as social media networking, online collaboration, and online
 promotional strategies. This project focuses on the high engagement levels exhibited by youth
 who are exercising these new skills regularly. By aligning their existing skills set with local
 business needs, immediate employment opportunities can be facilitated. As a participant in
 this phase of the project, you will be asked to use the mobile software application that was
 developed for these employment opportunities.<br /><br />

This statement contains information about the present study that is intended to help you

<b>Study Objective</b><br />

The primary goal of this project is to deepen our understanding about the role of ‘new’ digital
 technologies in rural youth retention. By using the innovative software proposed here, we
 hope to provide a low-cost solution that fosters digital skills learning, yields immediate
 employment opportunities, and improves rural communities’ competitive position in the digital
 economy.<br /><br />

<b>Procedure: Phase 4 – Software Usage (Minimum expected time: 1 hour)</b><br />
You will be asked to complete the following tasks using our software:

<ul>
	<li>Create an account</li>
	<li>Complete the account profile</li>
	<li>Build a target digital portfolio based on a job ad for each open position in your
business</li>
	<li>Search for candidates that match the requirements of these portfolios</li>
</ul>

A researcher will assist you in completing these tasks. Over time, you may choose to use the
 software more by making changes to what you entered, by adding more portfolios for new job
 openings in your business, or by conducing more searches. To complete these tasks, you
 may spend as little or as much time as desired over the next three months. We expect that
 the more time you spend using and exploring the software, the more value you will gain from it.<br /><br />

<b>Risks</b><br />

There are no anticipated risks in participating in any part of this study.<br /><br />

<b>Benefits</b><br />

There is no monetary compensation for participating in this phase of the project. By
 volunteering for this project, participants will learn about research in rural development,
 psychology, digital literacy, and computer science. <br /><br />

<b>Privacy and confidentiality</b><br />

Names of participants will be stored separately from information collected. Your name will not
 be associated in any way with the information collected about you or your usage of the
 computer during the study. Specifically, we are interested in collecting data that tells us which
 part of the software is most useful for you, which aspect is used the most, the types of jobs
 and required skills are in demand, the digital skills of the candidates that you search for, and
 the effort spent in updating your own profile and target digital portfolios. Furthermore,
 because the interest of this study is to develop mobile software for use in developing a
 person’s digital portfolio for use in particular job applications, you will not be identified in any
 way in any written reports of this research. All the data collected as part of this study will be
 stored on a server hosted at the University of British Columbia. <br /><br />

Participants have a right to access their own results so long as their names and numeric tags
 are still available. The data obtained from the phases of the study will be retained for at least
 5 years after publication in secured, electronic form, which only researchers associated with
 this research will have access to. No audio or video tapes will be used. General results of the
 research study may be available through publications. A summary of the results will be made
 available to participants upon request.<br /><br />

<b>Concerns about participants’ rights</b><br />

If you have any concerns about your rights as a research participant and/or your experiences
 while participating in this study you may contact the Research Subject Information Line in the
 UBC Office of Research Services at 1-877- 822-8598 or the UBC Okanagan Research
