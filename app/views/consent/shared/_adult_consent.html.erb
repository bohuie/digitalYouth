<h2><center>INFORMED CONSENT: SYSTEM USAGE</center></h2>
<br />
<b>Introduction</b><br />

You are invited to participate in a research project that concerns the problem of how to help
 youths in rural communities stay local and how to increase local job opportunities that require
 new digital skills, such as social media networking, online collaboration, and online
 promotional strategies. We are writing to you today to request for your participation in our
 study. Detailed information about the study and a consent form is provided in this letter. This
 information is intended to help you decide whether you agree to participate. You are free to
 choose whether to give your consent or not. Also, even after you sign, you are free to
 withdraw at any time if you and/or your parent/guardian decide to do so at a later time. If you
 withdraw from this study, it will not affect your relationship with the people involved in the
 study, the universities involved, or the services the universities may provide to you. If you
 have any questions about this study before, during, or after your participation, please feel free
 to direct them to:<br />

<b>What is this research about?</b><br />
This project focuses on helping youths who are highly engaged online in developing related
 job skills that are useful in the local businesses. We know that many of todays’ youths use
 technologies regularly and are very skilled. One goal of the research is to develop software
 that will match skilled youth with businesses in the local area searching for employees with
 technology skills. As a participant in this phase of the study, your child will be asked to help
 design the mobile software application to be used in these employment opportunities. By
 developing the innovative software proposed here, we hope to provide a low-cost solution that
 fosters digital skills learning, yield immediate employment opportunities, and improve rural
 communities’ competitive position in the digital economy.<br /><br />

<b>What will I be asked to do?</b><br />

You will be asked to use the software developed as part of this project. A minimum of 1 hour
 is needed. A summary of the tasks is provided below.
<ul>
	<li>Create an account</li>
	<li>Complete the account profile</li>
	<li>Build a digital portfolio</li>
	<li>Search for available jobs in your local region that are of interest to you</li>
</ul>

A researcher will assist you in completing these tasks. Over time, you may choose to use the
 software more by updating your profile, by updating your digital skills, or by searching for
 available jobs in your community or surrounding communities. To complete these tasks, you
 may spend as little or as much time as desired over the next three months. We expect that
 the more time you spend using and exploring the software, the more value you will gain from
 it. <br /><br />

<b>What happens if I change my mind about participating?</b><br />

You are free to withdraw at any time. You can do this by contacting the researcher listed
 above or you can also send an email to the primary researcher Dr. Bowen Hui via email at
 bowen.hui@ubc.ca. If you do withdraw after participating in one or more of the sessions, we
 may continue to use the input you provided during these sessions.<br /><br />

<b>What benefits and risks associated with this study?</b><br />

There are no anticipated risks in participating in any part of this study.
 There is no monetary compensation for participating in this phase of the project. By
 volunteering for this project, participants will learn about research in rural development,
 psychology, digital literacy, and computer science.<br /><br />

<b>What will happen with the information I provide?</b><br />

Names of participants will be stored separately from information collected. Your name will not
 be associated in any way with the information collected about you or your usage of the
 computer during the study. Specifically, we are interested in collecting data that tells us which
 part of the software is most useful, which aspect is used the most, the types of jobs and
 required skills that searched for, and the effort spent in updating one’s own profile and
 portfolio. Furthermore, because the interest of this study is to develop mobile software for use
 in developing a person’s digital portfolio for use in particular job applications, you will not be
 identified in any way in any written reports of this research. All the data collected as part of
 this study will be stored on a server hosted at the University of British Columbia.<br /><br />

Participants have a right to access their own results so long as their names and numeric tags
 are still available. The data obtained from the phases of the study will be retained for at least
 5 years after publication in secured, electronic form, which only researchers associated with
 this research will have access to. No audio or video tapes will be used. General results of the
 research study may be available through publications. A summary of the results will be made
 available to participants upon request.<br /><br />

<b>Who do I contact if I have concerns about participants’ rights?</b><br />

If you have any concerns about your rights as a research participant and/or your experiences
 while participating in this study you may contact the Research Subject Information Line in the
 UBC Office of Research Services at 1-877- 822-8598 or the UBC Okanagan Research
