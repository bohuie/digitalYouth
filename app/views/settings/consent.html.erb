<b>Introduction</b><br />

You are invited to participate in a research project that concerns the problem of how to help
 youths in rural communities stay local and how to increase local job opportunities that require
 new digital skills, such as social media networking, online collaboration, and online
 promotional strategies. We are writing to you today to request for your participation in our
 study. Detailed information about the study and a consent form is provided in this letter. This
 information is intended to help you decide whether you agree to participate. You are free to
 choose whether to give your consent or not. Also, even after you sign, you are free to
 withdraw at any time if you and/or your parent/guardian decide to do so at a later time. If you
 withdraw from this study, it will not affect your relationship with the people involved in the
 study, the universities involved, or the services the universities may provide to you. If you
 have any questions about this study before, during, or after your participation, please feel free
 to direct them to:<br />

<b>What is this research about?</b><br />
This project focuses on helping youths who are highly engaged online in developing related
 job skills that are useful in the local businesses. We know that many of todays’ youths use
 technologies regularly and are very skilled. One goal of the research is to develop software
 that will match skilled youth with businesses in the local area searching for employees with
 technology skills. As a participant in this phase of the study, your child will be asked to help
 design the mobile software application to be used in these employment opportunities. By
 developing the innovative software proposed here, we hope to provide a low-cost solution that
 fosters digital skills learning, yield immediate employment opportunities, and improve rural
 communities’ competitive position in the digital economy.<br /><br />

<b>What will I be asked to do?</b><br />

You will be asked to use the software developed as part of this project. A minimum of 1 hour
 is needed. A summary of the tasks is provided below.
<ul>
	<li>Create an account</li>
	<li>Complete the account profile</li>
	<li>Build a digital portfolio</li>
	<li>Search for available jobs in your local region that are of interest to you</li>
</ul>

A researcher will assist you in completing these tasks. Over time, you may choose to use the
 software more by updating your profile, by updating your digital skills, or by searching for
 available jobs in your community or surrounding communities. To complete these tasks, you
 may spend as little or as much time as desired over the next three months. We expect that
 the more time you spend using and exploring the software, the more value you will gain from
 it. <br /><br />

<b>What happens if I change my mind about participating?</b><br />

You are free to withdraw at any time. You can do this by contacting the researcher listed
 above or you can also send an email to the primary researcher Dr. Bowen Hui via email at
 bowen.hui@ubc.ca. If you do withdraw after participating in one or more of the sessions, we
 may continue to use the input you provided during these sessions.<br /><br />

<b>What benefits and risks associated with this study?</b><br />

There are no anticipated risks in participating in any part of this study.
 There is no monetary compensation for participating in this phase of the project. By
 volunteering for this project, participants will learn about research in rural development,
 psychology, digital literacy, and computer science.<br /><br />

<b>What will happen with the information I provide?</b><br />

Names of participants will be stored separately from information collected. Your name will not
 be associated in any way with the information collected about you or your usage of the
 computer during the study. Specifically, we are interested in collecting data that tells us which
 part of the software is most useful, which aspect is used the most, the types of jobs and
 required skills that searched for, and the effort spent in updating one’s own profile and
 portfolio. Furthermore, because the interest of this study is to develop mobile software for use
 in developing a person’s digital portfolio for use in particular job applications, you will not be
 identified in any way in any written reports of this research. All the data collected as part of
 this study will be stored on a server hosted at the University of British Columbia.<br /><br />

Participants have a right to access their own results so long as their names and numeric tags
 are still available. The data obtained from the phases of the study will be retained for at least
 5 years after publication in secured, electronic form, which only researchers associated with
 this research will have access to. No audio or video tapes will be used. General results of the
 research study may be available through publications. A summary of the results will be made
 available to participants upon request.<br /><br />

<b>Who do I contact if I have concerns about participants’ rights?</b><br />

<b>Introduction</b><br />

You are invited to participate in a research project that concerns the problem of how to help
 youths in rural communities stay local and how to increase local job opportunities that require
 new digital skills, such as social media networking, online collaboration, and online
 promotional strategies. This project focuses on the high engagement levels exhibited by youth
 who are exercising these new skills regularly. By aligning their existing skills set with local
 business needs, immediate employment opportunities can be facilitated. As a participant in
 this phase of the project, you will be asked to use the mobile software application that was
 developed for these employment opportunities.<br /><br />

This statement contains information about the present study that is intended to help you
 decide whether you wish to participate in it. You may refuse to complete this form and not
 participate in this study. You should be aware that even after you completed the form, you are
 free to withdraw at any time. If you withdraw from this study, it will not affect your relationship
 with the people involved in the study, the universities involved, or the services the universities
 may provide to you. If you have any questions about this study before, during, or after your
 participation, please feel free to direct them to:<br />

<b>Study Objective</b><br />

The primary goal of this project is to deepen our understanding about the role of ‘new’ digital
 technologies in rural youth retention. By using the innovative software proposed here, we
 hope to provide a low-cost solution that fosters digital skills learning, yields immediate
 employment opportunities, and improves rural communities’ competitive position in the digital
 economy.<br /><br />

<b>Procedure: Phase 4 – Software Usage (Minimum expected time: 1 hour)</b><br />
You will be asked to complete the following tasks using our software:

<ul>
	<li>Create an account</li>
	<li>Complete the account profile</li>
	<li>Build a target digital portfolio based on a job ad for each open position in your
business</li>
	<li>Search for candidates that match the requirements of these portfolios</li>
</ul>

A researcher will assist you in completing these tasks. Over time, you may choose to use the
 software more by making changes to what you entered, by adding more portfolios for new job
 openings in your business, or by conducing more searches. To complete these tasks, you
 may spend as little or as much time as desired over the next three months. We expect that
 the more time you spend using and exploring the software, the more value you will gain from it.<br /><br />

<b>Risks</b><br />

There are no anticipated risks in participating in any part of this study.<br /><br />

<b>Benefits</b><br />

There is no monetary compensation for participating in this phase of the project. By
 volunteering for this project, participants will learn about research in rural development,
 psychology, digital literacy, and computer science. <br /><br />

<b>Privacy and confidentiality</b><br />

Names of participants will be stored separately from information collected. Your name will not
 be associated in any way with the information collected about you or your usage of the
 computer during the study. Specifically, we are interested in collecting data that tells us which
 part of the software is most useful for you, which aspect is used the most, the types of jobs
 and required skills are in demand, the digital skills of the candidates that you search for, and
 the effort spent in updating your own profile and target digital portfolios. Furthermore,
 because the interest of this study is to develop mobile software for use in developing a
 person’s digital portfolio for use in particular job applications, you will not be identified in any
 way in any written reports of this research. All the data collected as part of this study will be
 stored on a server hosted at the University of British Columbia. <br /><br />
